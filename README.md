The link to the finished assignment is https://daniel-edwards56.github.io/homework-1/
in this assignment i restructured the layout of the css to be more consise aswell as 
grouping parts of the code in both html and css so that it's easier to see what part of the 
webpage the code is applying to. While also updating all changes with commits to github and hosting
the page via github pages
